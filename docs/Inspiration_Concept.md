# Vibrating Watch Timer

----
## What is its concept?
Everyone needs to take breaks at work.  Research shows that taking a break several times per hour is good for your BRAIN, as described in this book: NeuroWisdom - https://amzn.to/2xPMfvo.
I've been using this technique of taking breaks with timers on my smartphone.  I came up with a similar concept for a 'Vibrating Watch Timer' - smart watchapp, which solves the following shortcomings of using a phone by:

1. *gettting rid of the need to always carry your phone with you and around the office*
2. *doesn't disturb your cubicle mates with sounds*
3. *you won't worry about phone being on do-not-disturb mode, thus missing a timer*
4. *you won't miss the timer when you have sound-blocking headphones on your ears*
5. *it won't prevent you from using your phone for more important things (i.e. email, videos, notifications, calendar, etc.)*

This watch timer vibrates on a user's wrist.  Simple, right :).  It is unobtrusive, accessible, and fun to use.  The vibration pattern is be customized (one buzz, three buzzes, five buzzes, or one very long buzz).  Also, the timer can be set to repeat for any number of intervals, with breaks in between.

----> Question from Yuliia: "User sets timer details (https://marvelapp.com/7iab626/screen/51207912) as 27min and 2 repeats and run it.
Does that mean what timer will vibrate first time in 27 min with possibility to stop or go to next 27min interval?"
----> Answer from Igor: "You are correct. The timer should also auto-start the next interval (after it finishes vibrating)."
